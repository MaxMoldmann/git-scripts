; List all the Repositories here for backup by Rsync (called by git_auto_backup.cmd)
; Rsync can be used to backup regular Git repos and Repos with a seperate Git folder.
; See LinkedIn article about seperate Git folders: 
; (https://www.linkedin.com/posts/max-moldmann_ever-wished-the-git-repository-would-be-stored-activity-7294871518700781569-ZB9v)

; NOTES:
; git-auto-backup.cmd and Rsync use a base directory from which repositories are being referenced. 
; Below folders are all relative to a base backup folder e.g.: c:\workspace
; If you want to include other git repos into the backup you can create a NTFS Junction to 
; another folder outside the workspace folder using the LinkShellExtension 
; (https://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/linkshellextension.html)
; E.g. c:\workspace\Scripts could be Junction to c:\Scripts in order to include the Scripts and 
; its git folder in the repo backup
